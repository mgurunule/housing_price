## Project Overview

Housing price prediction is the process of using statistical and machine learning models to forecast the future prices of residential properties. This project provides a Flask API to perform housing price predictions.

## Prerequisites

List the prerequisites needed to run your project. Include information about the required software, packages, and any other dependencies.

* Python 3.9.13
* pip 
* Virtual environment (optional but recommended)


## Installation
(These steps are for a Windows machine.)

1) Clone the repository to your local machine:                       
    ```git clone https://github.com/mgurunule/housing_price.git```
2) Navigate to the project directory:               
    ``` cd housing_price```                       
3) Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):                     
   ```python -m venv venv```                         
   or                                    
   Manually create from IDE.
4) Activate the virtual environment.                                    
    * on windows                            
      ```venv\Scripts\activate```               
5) Install project dependencies:                           
  ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```


**Note:** Don't forget to deactivate the virtual environment when you're done:
```deactivate```


## Usage

1) Once the installation is done run the below command to start the API.

   ```python app.py```

2) run test_app.py from the project.
    
    Note: Please verify the api url of ```test_app.py``` with the url generated by running ```app.py``` Port number 
      may change sometime. So please pass the port number shown after the ```python app.py```.                    
      If not same please modify the url in ```test_app.py```


3) test_app.py will print the expected dataframe with predicted value.
   This app.py program takes input in the form of json.


4) To run all th test case. type ```pytest``` from root directory.

## Files
* `app.py` - Flask script which will open the endpoint. User will pass input data to this end point.
* `predict_from_model.py` -  This script will load the model, perform prediction and save the data in DB.  
* `requirements.txt` - pip dependencies
* `schema_prediction.json` - schema of input data.
* `validation_transformation.py` - This Script will perform validation and transformation of input data
* `test_app.py` - script to test the execution of api
* `housing_price/constants` - constants for the project
* `housing_price/databse`  - database related query file, operations file and DB storage.
* `housing_price/pipeline` - Script to perform data validation and data transformation.
* `housing_price/trained_model/model.joblib` - the computed model you should use 
* `housing_price/training_data/housing.csv` - data file to process and apply a model to it for creating predictions
* `housing_price/logger.py` - main logger script.
* `logs/` - log file of each run.
* `tests/` - pytest cases.


## Methods

### 1) Data Validation
    Basic validations were performed for this project.
    - Verified the number of columns
    - Verified the name of the columns
    - Verified the type of the columns
    - checked for complete null column

### 2) Data Transformation
    Basic transformations were performed for this project.
    - Dropping the rows having null
    - Encoding of categorical columns
    - Add Missing column 

### 3) Prediction
    - loading the model
    - perform prediction

### 4) DataBase Operations
      For this project 2 tables are created.
      1) predicted_data_table : table to save predicted output.
      2) transformed_data_table : table to save transformed output.
      
      (structure of tables are present in below location) 
          -> "housing_price/databse/query"

      Currently below opearation are possible.
        - DB connection      : create connection with db
        - inserting in table : insert record into table
        - fetch data from db : This will fetch complete data from DB.
      Note : future ehancement will be fetching data from DB based 
             on conditions.
         currently fetching from DB is not used any where are
         predicted data is directly send back to called program 
         in the form of json.
